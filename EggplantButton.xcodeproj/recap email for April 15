Hello Tom, 

Here is out recap email to Max from Button:

Our team has been quite productive this week until crunch time. 

Adrian worked on getting the login flow and  user register pages working. It allows users to create accounts and have login credentials via firebase. He is currently working on the itinerary history page, getting the activities to show but he needs to get the title of each itinerary to show above the activities.

Lisa worked on adapting the implemented random generator to populate the collection view cards. She is currently working on designing and implementing a side menu via container views programmtically.

Stephanie has been improving on many different existing features. She also implemented maps in the activity detail cards. She converted our cards from stack view to collection view. She also programmed an image picker for the user's profile pictures. She is currently working on the Yelp API to populate our nightlife cards.

Ian has been working on learning and implementing firebase through out our app via Swift. He created many data models locally and on firebase. He is currently working on the Itinerary view when the user has confirmed their activities. 

We plan on polishing and doing the last details and features next week.

Thank you, Tom!
